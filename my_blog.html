                    Sophie decided to spend what she had coined her crone years high in the mountains in a tiny cottage. Her family thought this was a terrible idea and that was precisely why she knew it was a good one.

                    It was surprisingly inexpensive to acquire one—but after that the real work began. Supplies, repairs, figuring out how the hell to make bread. But that first loaf that came out perfectly…
                    
                    “I am crone, and I am free!” she shouted to the wind.
                    
                    She hiked down to the village every other day and gradually crowded her cottage shelves with teacups in every colour along with trinkets that served no purpose but to please her. She filled her pantry with everything she needed by week, made glorious soups and greeted every morning sunrise from her bath near the largest window.
                    
                    Then she started to paint.
                    
                    She had collected every colour, her true purpose in coming to this little cottage life. Now the colours needed out. She set up her first canvas, spread out her many paints and let the colours the sun had sent that day be her guide. The hours alone, colour her only companion, made her feel just as she had imagined they would.
                    
                    She had just one neighbour, Hal, a salt-and-pepper fellow of five words or less. This suited her just fine. She had not come all the way up a mountain for company.

                    The room is unfamiliar. I don't know how I got here. But I know it to be a prison cell, cold and dank.

                    I remember that the Praesidium of Magistrates say I am to die. They say I killed a man, that I am a murderer. Maybe these things are true, but they are only part of the truth.
                    
                    They say that Headsman Taliesan has been summoned from the Royal Palace, that he is to arrive on Fairday. That noon on Fairday is to be the hour of my death.
                    
                    They say Pastor Yakob shall tend to my spiritual needs, so that I may repent and save my immortal soul. Yet, I have no fear for my immortal soul, did our Lord Kristos not teach that the pure in heart shall see The Glory of the Gods?
                    
                    In my cell, I sleep beneath a scant eiderdown that does not ward away the creeping cold, my head upon pillows that hold the remnant nightmares of every lost soul who has slept here before me.</article>

                    We’re seeing some big storms roll through south of the capital region, bringing hail and even a few isolated funnel clouds…


                    Rachel mutes the forecaster waving his arms at the churning mass of red, yellow and green spinning in their direction on the radar map. 
                    
                    
                    She retrieves ice cubes from the freezer that hiss and spit with displeasure as they’re plunked into a glass of ginger ale.
                    
                    
                    She slides the patio door aside and hovers in the midst of combat between the heavy humidity and the cool AC. She lifts a trembling hand to her brow, shielding her eyes against the hazy afternoon.
                    
                    
                    Crickets sizzle in the wheat field behind the fence. A dog barks two doors down. A bead of sweat slips down her spine like the condensation on her glass. 
                    
                    
                    A growl grumbles in the distance, deep from the chest of the grotesque purple clouds gathering on the horizon.
